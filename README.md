### Hi, I'm Peter ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Java and C# in my course at Certificate IV and Diploma level in Melbourne, Australia. Very interested in developing a greater knowledge about JavaScript and web development - currently working through freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project to learn a little more outside of class.
