In our React Development course at General Assembly we were tasked with creating a Todo list in React. I wanted to create a skeumorphic interpretation of a real notebook page, so I took photos of paper and an eraser to incorporate them into the design. The font used is Sriracha from Google Fonts, the accompanying UI elements I created SVGs from hand-drawn images to match the look and feel of the Sriracha font.

I set myself the task of creating a piano keyboard using CSS with the requirement that it retains realistic proportions and keys overlap as they would on a real piano. I am also interested in learning about how to synthesize sounds in the browser, and this was my introduction to the Web Audio API - something I hope to continue learning more about in future.
