### Hi, I'm Peter ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, Java and C# in my course at Certificate IV level in Melbourne, Australia. I'm working through CS50 over the Christmas break, and enjoying learning more about C. Also very interested in developing a greater knowledge about JavaScript and web development - tinkering with Node.js, React, Gatsby, etc.
