For the final project in my React Development course, I have chosen to create an application that allows users to rate businesses and venues aginst their suitability as a remote working venue. Basic information about each venue is retrieved from the Google Places API and users are able to add their remote work specific review information within the application.

When using Google's Matterial Design 3 colour palette generator one feature I found wanting is the lack live colour updates. My palette generator uses React state to handle HSL values which are rendered live in the UI as they are altered. Colours and tonal variations can then be copied to the clipboard for use in your preferred editor.

### React Todo List
[![React Todo List](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62582081/158084900-7397dd14-4d9a-426e-8c62-5ecef7c67c0a.png)](https://peter-hinch.github.io/general-assembly-react-todo-list/)

In our React Development course at General Assembly we were tasked with creating a Todo list in React. I wanted to create a skeumorphic interpretation of a real notebook page, so I took photos of paper and an eraser to incorporate them into the design. The font used is Sriracha from Google Fonts, the accompanying UI elements I created SVGs from hand-drawn images to match the look and feel of the Sriracha font.

### Web Audio API Piano

I set myself the task of creating a piano keyboard using CSS with the requirement that it retains realistic proportions and keys overlap as they would on a real piano. I am also interested in learning about how to synthesize sounds in the browser, and this was my introduction to the Web Audio API - something I hope to continue learning more about in future.
